## use microservices archtecture for loan-settlement-release demo

the BPM engine plans to use Camunda, jBPM, flowable. in case of flowable, we use springboot. Other two use ejb.

### 4 micro services: loan, settlement, release, delivery service

    each has its db, ejb services. Transaction boundary is limited to its service, not accross micro service.

#### delivery service

        CLS internal delivery service to provide the capability of delivering message via different approaches, such as MQ, email. By default, we first implement MQ delivery. The delivery virtually does not send by itself, rather as a bridge to 3rd delivery system.

#### loan service

        has a loan process, loan service should have the capability of: listen external request to create a loan.
        createBy, update, settlement

#### settlement 

##### settlement service

        settlementInit, settlementSummary, settlementRelease

##### payment service

        payment message service to maintain the lifecycle of sort of payment message, aka payment advice.
        create, update, send, delete?? 

#### release service

        release

### jBPM compensation

also check camunda compensation, flowable compensation
